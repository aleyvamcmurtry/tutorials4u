          <h2>Logging into Unity Part 2</h2>
        
        <p>Yay we're back at the Unity application!</p>
        <p>Click on Continue. A page that says License management will appear
        and it will be asking you ask you whether you are using Unity for Personal or Business use. 
        (also known as Plus or Pro). Make sure to choose Personal and click Next. The License agreement 
        will appear and it will ask you to select one of the options below. Read through the next bullet
        points that appear, and select the last check box (the one that says I don't use Unity in a professional capacity).
        If you don't select it, Unity may try to charge you for using their product. Unity wants to know this
        so they can know who is using Unity for fun and to learn new things and who is using it to make money.</p>
        <p>Once you select the last option, click Next.</p>
        <p>After that is all done Unity will begin asking you a few questions.It is mandatory for you to answer
        them, but here are the questions they asked and how I answered them. Answer the questions to the best
        of you ability.</p>
        <p>Where are you located? - It is asking what country you live in.</p>
        <p>In what capacity do you primarily use Unity? - You can choose the option that you think
        best fits you. You can choose either Student or Hobbyist. (I chosed Hobbyist.)</p>
        <p>What is your primary role? - It is asking what your role or what your think your job is when
        you are making projects in Unity. I chosed Game Designer and Programmer, but you can also
        choose Artist, Audio Designer, Student, or all of them. </p>
        <p>How would you rate your Unity skills? - Have you played with Unity before? Is this your first time?
        Choose one of the options (besides Advanced or Expert, unless you are one).</p>
        <p>Platforms of interest. - What are you interested in creating for? Are you interested 
        in creating apps for Android, Gear VR, Oculus Rift? In these tutorials we are making something
        for Google Cardboard (or something similar to it) if you want to choose that one. </p>
        <p>What type of content do you primarily plan to develop with Unity? - You can only choose one
        of these unfortunately. In our case, we are making Games. </p>
        
        <p>When you have answered all of these questions, click on Ok and Start Using Unity.</p>
