          <p>Awesome! You have downloaded Unity, installed, and logged in. Please take a moment to give yourself a round of applause. 

             <p> Before we get to making an awesome game, we have to go through something a little boring first. Boring, but important. </p>
              
              <p>We are going to learn about the different parts of Unity, or as programmers like to call it, the Unity Interface.
              This is a short term used to mean all of the parts of Unity, from the giant screen with an image of a sky to
              all of the bits and pieces that help us to create projects.</p>
              
              <p>First lets go ahead and start Unity if you haven’t already started that. </p>
              
             <p> Click on the Unity icon on your Desktop. If you don't see it there, go into your applications folder and search for it
              on there if you have a Mac. If you are using a PC, type in Unity in the search bar on the bottom of your screen select
              the Desktop app. </p>
              
              <p>After clicking on it, the Unity home screen should pop up. This is the place where we can create new projects and work 
              on our old ones.</p>
              
             <p>Lets click on +New. This is going to let us create a new project to work on. </p>
              
              <p>Under Project Name, type in the name of your project. I’m going to name my project Project1.</p>
              
             <p>Next to Project Name is Template. This is what style your project is going to be in, whether you want to create a 2D game
              or a 3D game. Since we are making a Virtual Reality game, choose 3D.</p>
              
              <p>After this, click on Create Project. You shouldn't have to touch any of the other items on this screen unless you want to 
              change where your project is going to be made. 
               </p>
        
              <p><b>If you ever have any problems go to <a href="help2">Tutorial 2 Help</a>.</b></p>
              
               <p> Welcome to the Unity interface! This is where we will be making our game. Before we start with that, 
                we need to get ourselves familiar with all of the different components, or items, that is on this screen.</p> 
                
               <p> While we won’t be going into detail about every little thing on here, we do want to at least have an idea 
                about what most of this stuff does. </p>
                
               <p> For example, what is a ‘Menu Bar’? What does this play button do? What is this huge screen in front of us do?</p>
                
                <p>You will be learning all of this over the next few sections. </p>
                
               <p> For the moment, let us start with the names for each area. </p>
                
               <p> At the very top of Unity, you will see the words ‘File’, ‘Edit’, ‘Window’, etc. The name for this entire
                section is the Menu Bar. The Menu Bar is essentially an a place where you can save your project, create
                new objects, look for help, and change things. It has the most things you can play with.</p>
                
               <p> Next up is the Tool Bar. The Tool Bar is all of the items and symbols that are right below the Menu Bar.
                All of these symbols mean and do different things. Can you guess what they all do?</p>
                
               <p> To the left of your screen, you will see the Hierarchy Window. This is where you can see everything you
                are currently using in your project. You can interact with the stuff in here, create quick objects, and
                with one click, look at your object (like a cube or the lights) and find more information in the
                Inspector Window.  </p>
                
               <p> Now to the very right of your screen, you will see the Inspector Window. This is where you can find 
                information about your object and make changes. For example, you can change the color of a tree or a
                car here. </p>
                
               <p> The very big screen in the middle of Unity is called the Scene View, or #Scene. The Scene View, is
                where we can see, move, and interact with items we create. </p>
                
                <p>If you click on the tab next to #Scene, we will get the Game View. The Game View shows us how 
                the game will look to our players. </p>
                
                <p>At the bottom of Unity, you will see a folder called Project. This is the Project View. This 
                has stuff called Favorites, Assets, and Packages already in there. In here you can save copies
                of things you create in your Hierarchy so you can reuse them. Also anything you download from 
                the Assets store will pop up here.  </p>
                
               <p> One part of the Project View is the Console. We will use this to figure out if there’s any problems 
                with our game and how to solve them. We might not be able to solve every problem, but we can use the
                information this prints out to find out where and what may be the issue. </p>
                
            
              <p>Here is a little overview about the different sections of Unity. In the next chapter, we will be 
              going over some of the details of the Menu Bar. </p>
