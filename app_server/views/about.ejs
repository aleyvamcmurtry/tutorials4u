          <p>Angelica L.M.</p>
          <p>Angelica is the creator of Tutorials4Unity. This is currently her Masters Thesis project. 
          She wants to thank you for being patient as tutorials and pages are added. </p>
          
          <h3 class="major">About the Project</h3>
         
          <p>Tutorials4Unity is a project I started with the aim to help make learning
          on how to build a basic Virtual Reality game easy for those with little to no 
          programming experience. This project is for kids and teens who are interested
          in getting into video game making, but they don't know where to start. </p>
          <p>After going along with other tutorials, I realized that many of the ones for
          beginners either charge money or are not as easy to digest for those
          who have never programmed before. I decided to create these tutorials to close this gap,
          with the aim to teach everyone, no matter the expertise.</p>
          
          <h3 class="major">What are the main components of this project?</h3>
          <p>On the website itself, I am using a bootstrap template that I found on http://html5up.net 
          that was free to use as long as it was either for educational purposes or for nonprofit. </p>
          <p>The website follows the MEAN Stack (Mongodb, Express, Angular, Nodejs). I personally only
          used Nodejs only because I have not created logins for users and I do not need to store data
          outside of the tutorials themselves.</p>
          <p>I mainly hardcoded all of the tutorials using HTML, with some of the additional features,
          like the Top button, being used with Javascript, and the overall prettyness being used with CSS.</p>
          <p>Most of the pictures on the site I either did by hand or screenshot my own project.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For building the video game, I used the software Unity (hence name of my project), #C (C Sharp), 
          Google SDK, Android phone, and lots of patience and pratice.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The website is currently hosted on Heroku, with the source code on Github, and the changes
          all being made using Cloud9 by AWS. </p>
          
          <h3 class="major">What's next for this project?</h3>
          <p>I was originally adding in video tutorials for the users to watch and follow as well.
          Unfortunately, they took too long to make, with a basic video taking about two to three hours.
          More complicated videos took longer. The other problem was that Unity tends to change something 
          about their software, gui, or website once every couple of months, to the point where trying
          to update some of the videos was more headache.</p>
          <p>I still plan on making videos, but I plan on doing so at a later date.</p>
          <p>I want to eventually add in a login and signup functions, as well as a comment section,
          on each tutorial. The purpose of this would be for users to add in suggestions to fix the tutorials,
          problems they had, and to help others out. </p>
          <p>The last major idea I would like to incopporate is to include more virtual reality tutorials,
          with the tutorials building upon each other. </p>
